<p class="lead">Please ensure that you consider the following guidelines when preparing your book typescript.</p>

## Structure
### Main text
The body of the submission should be structured in a logical and easy to follow manner.

Up to three level headings may be present and must be clearly identifiable using different font sizes, bold or italics. We suggest using Headings 1, 2 and 3 in MS-Word’s ‘Style’ section.

### Front matter
Include all necessary preliminary pages:

- Title page
- Dedication or epigraph (optional)
- Table of contents
- List of tables and figures
- List of abbreviations (optional)
- Preface and/or acknowledgments (optional)

### Data Accessibility
If data, structured methods, or code used in the research project have been made openly available, a statement should be added to inform the reader how and where to access these files. This should include the repository location and the DOI linking to it. 

If it is not possible to use a repository, then UWP can host supplementary files.

Supplementary files will not be typeset, so they must be provided in their final form and must be submitted for review during the original submission process. They will be assigned a DOI and linked to from the publication by the publisher.

NOTE: If data used in the research project has not been made available, a statement confirming this should be added, along with the reasoning why.

### Ethics and consent (if applicable)
Where studies have been approved by an appropriate ethics committee, the authors should include a statement within the script detailing this approval, including the name of the ethics committee and reference number of the approval. The identity of the research subject(s) should be anonymised whenever possible. For research involving human subjects, informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from participants (or their legal guardian) and added to this statement.

### Acknowledgements (optional)
Any acknowledgements must be headed and in a separate paragraph, placed after the main text.
Funding Information (if applicable) should also be included here.
Should the underlying research have received a funding grant, then the grant provider and grant number should be detailed.

## References
UWP follows the Chicago Manual of Style for the formatting of citations. You may use Chicago-style notes (with or without a bibliography, depending on how the notes are formatted) or Chicago-style author/date references. Volume editors should alert contributors to the style selected; when the final manuscript is submitted, all chapters must follow the same citation style.

## Permissions
The author is responsible for obtaining all permissions required prior to submission of the manuscript. Permission and owner details should be mentioned for all third-party content included in the submission or used in the research.

If a method or tool is introduced in the study, including software, questionnaires, and scales, its license and any requirement for permission for use should be stated if required. If an existing method or tool is used in the research, it is the author's responsibility to check the license and obtain the necessary permissions. 

## Language & Text
### Capitalisation
For the submission title:

Capitalise all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions (e.g. as, because, although). Use lowercase for all articles, coordinate conjunctions and prepositions.
- Slip-Sliding on a Yellow Brick Road: Stabilization Efforts in Afghanistan

Headings within the main text:

All headings in the text should follow the same rule as the main title.

Headings should be under 75 characters.

### Spelling and grammar
Submissions must be made in English. Authors are welcome to use American or British spellings as long as they are used consistently throughout the whole of the submission.
- Colour (UK) vs. Color (US)

When referring to proper nouns and normal institutional titles, the official, original spelling must be used.
- World Health Organization, not World Health Organisation

American or English grammar rules may be used as long as they are used consistently and match the spelling format (see above). For instance, you may use a serial comma or not.
- red, white, and blue OR red, white and blue

### Chinese Romanisation
Use pinyin romanisation except for the small number of names most commonly found in other versions; Jyutping is preferred for Cantonese. Remember that pinyin does not use hyphens, e.g. Wen Jiabao, while Wade-Giles does, e.g. Sun Yat-sen. Use Chinese word order, family name first, for Chinese names. Chinese characters should be given in the text for names and places likely to be unfamiliar to a majority of readers. Please use Wylie for Tibetan.

The first instance of a key Chinese-language term in the text should provide English translation, pinyin and characters; subsequent uses should give only either the English translation or pinyin as appropriate.

### Font
The font used should be commonly available and in an easily readable size. This may be changed during the typesetting process.

Underlined text should be avoided whenever possible.

Bold or italicised text to emphasise a point are permitted, although should be restricted to minimal occurrences to maximise their efficiency. Indicate that emphasis has been added by stating ‘The emphasis is mine’ in your footnote.

Use italics for foreign words or phrases which have not been fully accepted into the English language: please check your dictionary.

Always use italics for titles of publications – i.e. books or periodicals – but not chapters or articles.

### Lists
Use bullet points to denote a list without hierarchy or order of value. If the list indicates a specific sequence then a numbered list must be used.

Lists should be used sparingly to maximise their impact.

### Quotation marks
Use single quotation marks except for quotes within another speech, in which case double quotation marks are used.

Quotations that are longer than three lines in length must be in an indented paragraph separate from the main text and without quotation marks. Block quotations should be introduced by a colon.

Within a quotation use the spelling and punctuation of the original. Use [sic] in such quotations to indicate that the original really spells or reads thus.  Your interpolations, if any, are contained within square brackets.

If omitting material from a quotation, use three ellipsis points … If your omission occurs after a complete sentence, you will, of course, have four periods.

Do not use ellipses to introduce or end quotes.

The standard, non-italicised font must be used for all quotes.

It must be clear from the text and/or citation where the quote is sourced from. If quoting from material that is under copyright, then permission will need to be obtained from the copyright holder.

### Acronyms & Abbreviations
With abbreviations, the crucial goal is to ensure that the reader – particularly one who may not be fully familiar with the topic or context being addressed – is able to follow along. Spell-out almost all acronyms on first use, indicating the acronym in parentheses immediately thereafter. Use the acronym for all subsequent references.
- Research completed by the World Health Organization (WHO) shows …

A number of abbreviations are so common that they do not require the full text on the first instance. Examples of these can be found here.

Abbreviations should usually be in capital letters without full stops.
- USA, not U.S.A

Common examples from Latin origin do not follow this rule and should be lower case and can include full stops.
- e.g., i.e., etc.

Use a full stop after an abbreviation, as Vic., vol., ed.; but not after a contraction which ends with the same letter as the word itself, as eds, vols, Mr, Dr etc.

Symbols for currency or units of measurement have no full stop: 5 km, 25 lb, £160 10s 6d. 

For abbreviations which consist of capitals, use no full stops as PRONI, except for personal names (H. Norman Bethune).

For personal names that use a number of initials, please place a gap between them (e.g. J. G. A. Pocock)

When a person’s name is introduced give the name in its entirety. Later uses should be of the surname or given name but not both.

### Data & Symbols
Symbols are permitted within the main text and datasets as long as they are commonly in use or have explanatory definition on their first usage.

Hyphenation, em and en dashes

There is no set rule on the use of hyphenation between words, as long as they are consistently used.

Em dashes should be used sparingly. If they are present, they should denote emphasis, change of thought or interruption to the main sentence and can replace commas, parentheses, colons, or semicolons.

- The president’s niece—daughter of his younger brother—caused a media scandal when…

En dashes can be used to replace ‘to’ when indicating a range. No space should surround the dash.
- 10-25 years
- pp. 10-65

### Numbers
Numbers and ordinals of up to one hundred are spelled out: twenty-five, three Rs, twentieth century.

Numbers over one hundred are given in figures: 279; except for round numbers: two hundred, five thousand, six million.

For percentages: 91 per cent, not 91%. If the sentence includes a series of numbers then figures must be used in each instance.
- Artefacts were found at depths of 5, 9, and 29 cm.

If the number appears as part of a dataset, in conjunction with a symbol or as part of a table then the figure must be used.
- This study confirmed that 5% of…

If a sentence starts with a number it must be spelt, or the sentence should be re-written so that it no longer starts with the number.
- One hundred and twelve examples were found to exist…
- The result showed that 112 examples existed…

Do not use a comma for a decimal place.
- 2.43 NOT 2,43

Numbers that are less than zero must have ‘0’ precede the decimal point.
- 0.24 NOT .24

### Dates
Dates are shown as: 16 October 1970.

Months, whether in the text of footnotes, should be spelled out in full.

Please avoid using an apostrophe when referring to decades: 1870s, 1900s.

A span of years is given as 1872–5. Or, for dates between the ‘10s and ‘20s as 1916–18.

### Units of measurement
Symbols following a figure to denote a unit of measurement must be taken from [the latest SI brochure](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/).

### Formulae
Formulae must be proofed carefully by the author. Editors will not edit formulae. If special software has been used to create formulae, the way it is laid out is the way they will appear in the publication.

## Figures & Tables
### Figures
Figures, including graphs and diagrams, must be professionally and clearly presented, and submitted as separate individual files ready for printing (i.e. not requiring any redrawing). If a figure is not easy to understand or does not appear to be of a suitable quality, the editor may ask to re-render or omit it.

All figures must be cited within the main text, in consecutive order using Arabic numerals, by chapter number (if there are figures in more than one chapter), e.g. Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2, Figure 2.1, etc.

Each figure must have an accompanying descriptive main title. This should clearly and concisely summarise the content and/or use of the figure image. A short additional figure legend is optional to offer a further description.

- Figure 1.1: 1685 map of London.
- Figure 1.1: 1685 map of London. Note the addition of St Paul’s Cathedral.

Figure titles and legends should be placed within the text document, either after the paragraph of their first citation, or as a list after the references.
The source of the image should be included, along with any relevant copyright information and a statement of authorisation (if needed).

- Figure 1.1: Firemen try to free workers buried under piles of concrete and metal girders. Photo: Claude-Michel Masson. Reproduced with permission of the photographer.

Each figure must also have accompanying alt text. Alt text – “alternative text” – is a short description (often 140 characters or fewer) of a visual item like a map or a picture. It is a specific visual resource that is not displayed on the digital page but is embedded in the electronic book and can be accessed via assistive technology. Alt text will make the electronic version of your book accessible to readers who have disabilities or use assistive technology to interact with digital content. See the [Author Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ophHc6i5g4KiEfBgyarmZozhbciXcL7Gj0kAQaWqUVs/edit?tab=t.0) for more information.

NOTE: All figures must be uploaded separately as supplementary files during the submission process, and at a resolution of at least 300dpi. Standard formats accepted are: JPG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, EPS. For line drawings, please provide the original vector file (e.g. .ai, or .eps).

### Tables
Tables must be created using a word processor's table function, not tabbed text.

Tables should be included in the manuscript. The final layout will place the tables as close to their first citation as possible.

All tables must be cited within the main text, and numbered with Arabic numerals in consecutive order by chapter, in the same way as figures (e.g. Table 1.1, Table 2.1, etc.).

Each table must have an accompanying descriptive title. This should clearly and concisely summarise the content and/or use of the table. A short additional table legend is optional to offer a further description of the table. The table title and legend should be placed above the table.

Tables should not include:
- Rotated text
- Colour to denote meaning (it will not display the same on all devices)
- Images
- Vertical or diagonal lines
- Multiple parts (e.g. ‘Table 1.1a’ and ‘Table 1.1b’). These should either be merged into one table, or separated into ‘Table 1.1’ and ‘Table 1.2’.

NOTE: If there are more columns than can fit on a single page, then the table will be placed horizontally on the page. If it still can't fit horizontally on a page, the table will be broken into two.

## References, Endnotes and Footnotes

References should be in the form of in-text citations. Use endnotes in preference to footnotes. Endnotes should be numbered from 1 within each chapter, and can be placed at the ends of chapters or at the end of the script (by chapter).

Additional information in footnotes should be used only where crucial clarifying information needs to be conveyed.

Please insert the footnote marker after the end punctuation.

First time the work is referenced

NOTE: DOIs should be included at the end of the first reference for all items where possible.

### Books
All references should contain the following information in the order given: author’s initial(s) or given name(s) as used on the title page, and surname; title of the book, place of publication and year of publication; page reference if appropriate.

Idem is used to indicate ‘the same person or thing’ in order to avoid repetition within a footnote (as idem is not an abbreviation, it is not followed by a period):

Geoffrey R. Elton, The Tudor Revolution in Government (Cambridge, 1953); idem, *Policy and Police: The Enforcement of the Reformation in the Age of Cromwell* (Cambridge, 1972); idem, *Reform and Renewal: Thomas Cromwell and the Common Weal* (Cambridge, 1973).

Traditional characters should be used for publications in traditional characters; simplified for publications in simplified. The first word in titles in pinyin should be capitalised, along with proper nouns in the title.

For publications in other foreign languages, please follow the same pattern.

## Bibliographies
Bibliographies should be organised alphabetically in order of the first authors’ surnames. Unlike footnotes, the surname of the first author should appear before the first or given name. 

Kidd, Colin. *The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600-2000* (Cambridge, 2006).

Leerssen, Joep. *Remembrance and Imagination: Patterns in the Historical and Literary Representation of Ireland in the Nineteenth-Century* (Cork, 1996).

*History of the Speculative Society of Edinburgh* (Edinburgh, 1845)

Locke, John. *Some Thoughts concerning Education* (London, 1694)

The bibliography can be subdivided according to the nature of the material cited (manuscript material, printed primary material, and secondary sources for example). Where done, this should be in accordance with common disciplinary norms.
