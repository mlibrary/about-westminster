<h2 id="issues">Non-accessible content</h2>

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

- The University of Westminster logo in the footer is a link, with an internal SVG graphic. The SVG has an aria-label which is unnecessary as the parent link already has an accessible name This fails WCAG 1.1.1 Non-text Content (A).
- Resizing text to 200% cause the vertical text on the Home page to have the top of each letter cropped This fails WCAG 1.4.4 Resize text (AA).
- The primary logo is not responsive and causes whole-page horizontal scrolling This fails WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow (AA).
- There is a yellow focus indicator present in the main navigation which only has a contrast of 1.2:1 against the grey background. The cards on the Home page have an indadequate contrast focus ring which is just 1.9:1 This fails WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (AA).
- There is no skip link present This fails WCAG 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (A).
- There is no secondary navigation mechanism available This fails WCAG 2.4.5 Multiple Ways (AA).
- The University of Westminster logo in the footer lacks a focus indicator. Some images in the footer have a focus indicator that appears on an adjacent element and could be the source of confusion This fails WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA).
- Misuse of the aria-haspopup property, which does not have an association with an allowed element This fails WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A).
