description: Former news reporter and founder of Africa’s first fact-checking
  organisation Peter Cunliffe-Jones argues that since concern about ‘information
  disorder’ soared in 2016, we have laboured under flawed assumptions about the
  nature and effects of ‘fake news’ and misinformation. Based on a four-year
  review of 250 case studies, Cunliffe-Jones sets out four ideas for
  fact-checkers, policymakers and platforms to curb harmful consequences and
  protect wider freedom of speech.
