title: Journal Proposal Submission Guidelines
---
<p class="lead">UWP welcomes proposals from editors and societies who would like to publish a new journal, or transfer an existing journal to be published, on an open access basis under the University of Westminster Press banner. You can submit your proposal by sending an <a href="/contact">email to the Press Manager</a>.</p>

## What We Need
For journals to be considered by UWP please submit a proposal following the guidelines below:
- Name of journal, subtitle and a description of the purpose of the journal in 100–200 words explaining why a journal is needed in the area and what is distinctive about your new journal.
- Details of principal editor/s including contact details and one paragraph detailing institutional affiliations, relevant previous publications and credentials for the role including memberships of relevant associations.
- Composition of the proposed editorial board including names of board members, academic affiliations and areas of subject expertise (2–3 sentences for each).
- Extent of journal and article length. How many issues a year?
- Any design or production preferences or requirements for the journal needed including use of illustrations, data, specialist typography or colour.
- Core readership and subject disciplines the journal intends to cover; any wider academic categories you think the journal may appeal to, or develop into.
- The nearest competing journals and why this new journal will succeed in attracting submissions.
- How should the readership for the journal be identified and reached? What factors do you think are most relevant in terms of ensuring the journal is successfully launched and creates an impact? 
- UWP normally like to discuss on an individual basis such matters as reference and style conventions, handling of the peer-review process, potential sponsorship and link-up with associations (if a society or department journal) but if you think it is important to mention these at an early stage, please include details. 

It is a condition for consideration that UWP journals are peer reviewed with reference to [COPE guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/guidance/Guidelines?t=peer+review&sort=score).

We suggest the following as headings for your proposal document:

- Background and aims of the journal
- Editors and Board
- Policies, Procedures, Practicalities
    - numbers of articles and issues
    - peer review
    - types of articles
    - other subject parameters
    - ethics
- Core readership and scope
- Competition and context
- Readership and marketing

## The Process
The journal proposal is first of all considered by UWP staff and associates as to whether it meets our guidelines and is a subject area in which we are planning to publish.

The journal proposal will then be reviewed externally by relevant scholars in the field.

If the reviews are favourable the proposal will be considered by the University of Westminster Press Editorial Board and a decision will be made quickly whether to proceed. 

UWP aim to undertake reviews of journals as expeditiously as possible and in no longer than 8 weeks from submission.
