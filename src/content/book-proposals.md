title: Book Proposal Submission Guidelines
---

<p class="lead">If you would like to know if UWP is interested in publishing your book, please submit a proposal following the guidelines below. You can send an email to the <a href="/contact">Press Manager</a> with any specific queries.</p>

## What We Need
The title of the book and a description in 150–200 words (effectively the blurb for the back cover of the book) explaining why a book is needed in the area and what is distinctive and unique about it in terms of intellectual contribution and market appeal. In addition, please include:

- A detailed contents list, and sample chapters if you have them, together with brief details of bibliography, appendices and other apparatus proposed.
- Details of author or principal editor/editor contact details and one paragraph detailing institutional affiliations, previous publications and relevant history of research underlying the book.
If an edited volume, details of the contributors including their academic affiliations and most significant and relevant publications (2–3 sentences only).
- The length of the book (in terms of the number of words plus the number of illustrations) and the proposed delivery date. If an edited book, the length of the individual contributions will be needed as well. 
- Any presentation preferences for typesetting or any production requirements for the book including use of illustration, data, specialist typography or colour printing if required.
- A description of the market for the book. 
- An account of competing titles and books most closely resembling yours; what is the book’s unique intellectual contribution?
- How should the readership for the book be reached? What factors do you think are most relevant in terms of ensuring the book is successfully published and makes an impact? Where should reviews be sought? 

It is a condition for consideration that UWP books are peer reviewed in accordance with standard university press practice.

## The Review Process
A book proposal is first of all considered by UWP staff, who will consider whether it meets our guidelines and is a subject area in which we are planning to publish.

The proposal (or script) will then be reviewed externally by not less than two relevant scholars in the field. 

If the reviews are favourable, the Press may offer an advance (conditional) contract for the book. This would require that the completed script be peer reviewed. Final acceptance of a script for publication will always be conditional upon the approval of our Editorial Board, based on these peer reviews and the author/editor response to the reviews. 

UWP aims to undertake reviews of book proposals and scripts as expeditiously as possible and in no longer than 10 weeks from submission of a manuscript.

Taking into consideration publication ethics, UWP are happy to consider requests for ‘open’ peer review if preferred.

Books, on publication, are simultaneously released free to readers in PDF and eBook and made available as a print-on-demand hardback or an accessibly priced paperback.

Authors are consulted about the presentation/design of the book and its marketing.
