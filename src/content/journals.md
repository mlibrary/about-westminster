        <h2>Active Travel Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal</h2>
        <p><i>Active Travel Studies</i> is a new, peer-reviewed, open-access journal intended to provide a source of authoritative research on walking, cycling and other forms of active travel.

It will perform the critical function of providing practitioners and policy makers with access to current and robust findings on all subjects relevant to active travel.</p>
