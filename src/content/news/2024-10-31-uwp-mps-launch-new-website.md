The University of Westminster Press and Michigan Publishing Services (MPS, part of the University of Michigan in the USA) have come together to launch a new trans-Atlantic publishing partnership that will improve the reach of Westminster’s publishing.

MPS has, via its Janeway journals platform, been facilitating UWP’s journals publishing for several years, and as of November 1st they will also be managing UWP’s book publishing via their Fulcrum platform.

MPS recently announced another new partnership with Liverpool University Press (LUP) – who are now its exclusive distribution partner for the UK and Europe. The move coincides with the launch of Liverpool Distribution Services, a new boutique sales, marketing and distribution service offered by LUP that aims to provide a genuine sense of transatlantic university press partnership. Via this MPS-LUP partnership UWP’s physical book order fulfilment will be handled by Wiley Distribution in West Sussex. In North America, UWP books in print form will be distributed by MPS’s partner, University of Chicago Press.

UWP currently hosts six well-respected journals, and has published 58 open-access books, with at least 8 more to be published in the next ten months. It is committed to being an entirely open-access, open-source, academy-owned publisher, aligned with Westminster’s values of research integrity, intellectual freedom, equity and inclusion, and responsible stewardship.
