[The University of Westminster Press](https://uwestminsterpress.co.uk) and [Michigan Publishing Services](https://services.publishing.umich.edu) (MPS, part of the University of Michigan in the USA) have launched a new transatlantic publishing partnership that will improve the reach of Westminster’s publishing.

MPS has, via the Janeway journals platform, been facilitating UWP’s journals publishing for several years, and as of November 1st they will also be managing UWP’s book publishing via their Fulcrum platform.

MPS recently announced that Liverpool University Press (LUP) is now its exclusive physical distribution partner for the UK and Europe. Liverpool Distribution Services is a new boutique sales, marketing and distribution service offered by LUP that aims to provide a genuine transatlantic university press partnership. Via this UWP-MPS-LUP collaboration, UWP’s physical book order fulfilment will now be handled by Wiley Distribution in West Sussex. In North America, UWP books in print form will be distributed by MPS’s existing partner, University of Chicago Press.

UWP currently hosts six well-respected journals, and has published 58 open-access books, with at least eight more to be published in the next ten months. It is committed to being an entirely open-access, open-source, university-owned publisher, aligned with academic publishing best-practice values of research integrity, intellectual freedom, equity and inclusion, and responsible stewardship.
