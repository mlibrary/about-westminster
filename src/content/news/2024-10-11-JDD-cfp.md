[Journal for Deliberative Democracy](https://delibdemjournal.org) (JDD) Special Features are single articles consisting of an editorial introduction followed by three to four short contributions from different authors. Special Features aim to facilitate debates and bring together various perspectives on one topic.

We will publish one Special Feature article per year on a specific theme, beginning in 2025. The theme is Perspectives from the Majority World.

While the aim of deliberative democracy is to contest inequalities and generate inclusive democratic spaces, deliberative democracy is still embedded in and intertwined with colonial legacies and Western cultural particularities.

In which ways do experiences, practices, concepts, and theories of deliberation from the Majority World challenge current debates on deliberative democracy? How do cultural diversity and colonial legacies shape deliberative and participatory practices and conceptions of democratic innovation?

Special Features are double-blind peer-reviewed and will be published open access with no cost to authors or readers.
