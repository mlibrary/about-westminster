The University of Westminster's Fyvie Hall at Regent Street was abuzz on the evening of Monday 7 October for the launch of Professor Graham Smith's new book *We Need To Talk About Climate: How Citizens' Assemblies Can Help Us Solve the Climate Crisis*. The book explains the variety of climate assemblies that have taken place so far at local, national and international levels and explains why they have captured the imagination of government and activists alike.

Joining him in a lively panel discussion of the book's themes was Miriam Levin, Director of Participatory Programmes at Demos, and Clare Farrell, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion and the Hard Art and Humanity Project.

The book has already received much positive publicity, see links below:
