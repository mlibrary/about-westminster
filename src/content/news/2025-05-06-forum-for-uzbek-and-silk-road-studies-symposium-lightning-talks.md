**Forum for Uzbek and Silk Road Studies Symposium: Lightning Talks**

**14 May 2025**

 

The Forum for Uzbek and Silk Road Studies (FUSRS) is a joint initiative between Westminster International University in Tashkent and the University of Westminster. These two institutions have  enjoyed a fruitful and mutually beneficial partnership for more than 20 years in which joint research activities have been developed. The Forum was inaugurated in 2021 so as to profile this research collaboration more effectively and to share the synergies that derive from it with the wider research community.

 

This symposium is one of a range of research events that take place across the year. As well as focusing on Uzbekistan, the Forum explores issues relating to the wider Eurasia region, supported by the University of Westminster Press [Silk Road Journal](https://silkroadjournal.online/).
