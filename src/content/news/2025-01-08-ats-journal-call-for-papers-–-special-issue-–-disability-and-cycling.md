Disabled people cycle, although data indicates to a lesser extent than non-disabled people. And whilst the research ecosystem around cycling more broadly is burgeoning, research specifically upon disability and cycling remains limited. This matters as an absence of knowledge and research about disabled people who cycle means disabled people remain invisible and excluded from policy and debate. Reflecting on this, we have, through collaboration with disabled people who cycle, identified four priority research areas for researchers who wish to contribute to and develop their work around these. We welcome international contributions as well as contributions from across disciplines.



Submitted articles do not have to conform to a traditional academic format, we welcome non-traditional pieces such as descriptions of lived experience, auto-ethnography, discussions, analysis of secondary datasets, and policy reflection. The contributions should align with the following four priority research areas:



1. Research into conflicting access needs or access frictions. For example, impact of cycling infrastructure on disabled people walking and wheeling.



2. Evaluation of active travel interventions to understand how effective they are in increasing the numbers of disabled people cycling.



3. Health and wellbeing benefits of cycling for disabled people.



4. How disability and cycling intersect with other parts of someone’s identity. For example, but not limited to, ethnicity, gender, income, family life.
