title: University of Westminster Press Governance
---
<p class="lead">The Press is governed by the <strong>Management Board</strong> which consists of the Chair of the Editorial Board, the Press Manager, the Research Environment and Scholarly Communications Lead, and two external members: one non-UW academic and one publishing professional. The Management Board’s role is to consider matters of finance, management and strategic direction for the Press, and not the academic merits of individual book and journal proposals (which is the role of the Editorial Board).</p>

Falling within the responsibility of the Research Environment and Scholarly Communications Lead (who sits on the Library & Archives Service senior management team and University Research Committee), UWP is part of university-wide planning and reporting via Student and Academic Services.

UWP is represented (as above) at University Research Committee and contributes to its remit to identify and disseminate good practice and innovation in relation to:

1. Open research practices including the Concordat on open research data and responsible research evaluation, and 
2. Open research infrastructure including the University of Westminster Press.

UWP also provides an annual report to the University’s Research and Knowledge Exchange Steering Committee.

All UWP's publications are assessed via peer review using specialist expert advisers from across the world before consideration by our **Editorial Board**, comprised of University of Westminster scholars.
